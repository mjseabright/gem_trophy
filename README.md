# gem_trophy
A 3D printable trophy designed in Solidworks. 

It features a gem on top with two arms that hold it up from a round base. 
It has a plaque on the front with text that is made from three parts to give high contrast text that is easy to print on a single extruded printer.

I designed them and printed two for a competition I ran at work.
